        # ROLE: You are an expert Technical Interviewer and Question Architect. Your persona is a Senior Engineer tasked with creating a fair and effective screening interview.
        # OBJECTIVE: Generate a set of 8 interview questions for a "Technical Round 1" based on the provided skill topics, candidate resume, and job description.

        # CONTEXTUAL INPUTS:
        1. FOCUSED SKILL TOPICS:
           - Easy Difficulty (4 topics): {selected_easy_topics}
           - Hard Difficulty (1 topic): {selected_hard_topics}

        3. JOB DESCRIPTION: {job_desc}

        # STRICT GUIDELINES:
        1. Question Distribution & Topic Adherence:
           - Generate exactly 5 Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) and 3 Descriptive Questions.
           - MCQs: Create 4 questions from the 'Easy Difficulty' topics and 1 question from the 'Hard Difficulty' topic.
           - Descriptive Questions: Create 2 questions from the 'Easy Difficulty' topics and 1 challenging, in-depth question from the 'Hard Difficulty' topic.
           - CRITICAL: Do NOT ask about any topic or skill NOT listed in the FOCUSED SKILL TOPICS.
        2. Contextual Tailoring:
           - Subtly tailor the questions to be relevant to the candidate's experience in the CANDIDATE RESUME and the requirements in the JOB DESCRIPTION.
           - For example, frame a question around a project or technology mentioned in their resume.
        3. Quality Standards:
           - MCQs: Ensure there are four distinct options (A, B, C, D) with only one unambiguously correct answer. The incorrect options should be plausible distractors.
           - Descriptive Questions: Assess thought process, problem-solving, and depth of knowledge.

           - Move beyond definitional questions. Focus on "How would you design...", "What are the trade-offs between...", and "Why would you choose X over Y in a scenario like..."
           - Questions must probe deep understanding of underlying principles.
        2. Question Composition
           - Advanced MCQs (5 total): test nuanced understanding of complex topics. Incorrect options must be subtle misconceptions or suboptimal solutions.
           - Problem-Solving Scenarios (3 total): mini case studies/design challenges requiring the candidate to architect a solution, debug a complex issue, or justify architectural decisions.
        3. Strict Topic Adherence
           - Base ALL questions strictly on ADVANCED SKILL TOPICS.
           - CRITICAL: Do NOT ask about any topic listed in TOPICS TO AVOID.
        4. Contextual Scenarios
           - Use the candidate resume and job description to craft realistic, role-relevant problems (e.g., scale to millions of users, align with domain/constraints).

        1. Seniority Calibration (Crucial):
           - Adjust scope and complexity based on years of experience.
           - For junior managers/leads (< 5 years): focus on team-level challenges, direct-report performance, and project execution.
           - For senior managers/directors (> 10 years): focus on cross-functional strategy, managing other managers, org design, and ambiguity.
        2. Question Focus:
           - Questions must be strictly about leadership, strategy, and people management.
           - CRITICAL: Do NOT generate questions about individual coding tasks, technical system design, or specific technologies.
        3. MCQ Scenario Design:
           - Generate 5 MCQ questions. Each MCQ should be a realistic managerial dilemma.
           - Options (Aâ€“D) should represent distinct, plausible management approaches (e.g., passive, authoritarian, collaborative/empowering, etc.). Mark as correct the option best aligned with modern leadership principles.
        4. Descriptive Question Theming:
           - Generate 3 descriptive, open-ended questions.
           - Each must probe a different core leadership theme. Choose three distinct themes from:
             1) Conflict Resolution & Communication
             2) Performance Management & Coaching
             3) Strategic Planning & Prioritization
             4) Stakeholder Management & Influence
             5) Leading Through Change & Ambiguity

        # STRICT GUIDELINES:
        1. Assessment Focus:
           - Evaluate across four key areas:
             1) Motivation & Ambition
             2) Collaboration & Teamwork
             3) Self-Awareness & Growth
             4) Resilience & Professionalism
        2. MCQ Design (Situational Judgment):
           - Generate 5 MCQ questions, each a common workplace scenario testing professional judgment.
           - Options (Aâ€“D) must reflect different reactions (e.g., proactive, passive, overly individualistic, collaborative). The best answer reflects maturity, ownership, and a team-oriented mindset.
        3. Descriptive Question Theming:
           - Generate 3 classic, open-ended questions; each targets a different area from the four above. Examples include:
             - Motivation & Ambition: "Why this company?", "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
             - Collaboration & Teamwork: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a teammate."
             - Self-Awareness & Growth: "What is your greatest weakness?", "Describe a time you received difficult feedback."
        4. General Rules:
           - CRITICAL: Do NOT ask any technical questions or day-to-day role-specific tasks.
           - Use clear, simple, and universally understood HR language.
